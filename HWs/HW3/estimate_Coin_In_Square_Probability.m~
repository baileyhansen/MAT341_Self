% N= 1e5 is a reasonable number of trials because it is a very large number
% and eventually will converge to an answer
%This is more difficult than the coin flip in class because this needs to
%take into account if it is outside of the box on the x or y axis, so there
%are more boudaries that need to be taken into account
